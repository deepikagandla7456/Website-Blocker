##  About

Website Blocker is a Python script that helps users avoid distractions by blocking specific websites (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) during a selected time (e.g., 7 AM to 10 AM).  
It works by modifying the systemâ€™s `hosts` file to redirect those websites to `127.0.0.1`, making them inaccessible during that period.

---

##  Limitations & Future Work

-  Requires admin/root privileges to edit system files.
-  Only works on local machines (Windows by default).
-  Time range is fixed in code (can be modified manually).

### Future Work

- Add GUI for selecting websites and blocking hours.
- Make cross-platform support for Mac/Linux easier.
- Notification before blocking/unblocking.
- Option to log blocked attempts.

---

##  Features

-  Set specific hours to block websites.
-  Improves focus and productivity.
-  Customizable website list and time range.
-  Automatically unblocks sites after the set time.

---

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OS: Windows (you can change path for Linux/Mac)

---

##  Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepikagandla7456/Website-Blocker.git
   cd Website-Blocker
2. Run the Script
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Make sure to run it as Administrator on Windows or use ```sudo``` on Mac/Linux.
 ## Usage
- This script continuously checks the system time.

- If current time is between 7 AM and 10 AM, it blocks the sites listed in ```website_list```

- Outside that time range, it unblocks those websites.

- You can change time and sites by editing the values in ```app.py```

***Websites like Facebook and Instagram open normally before the script starts running.***

**During Blocked Hours**
 
***When the script runs between 7 AM and 10 AM, the listed websites are blocked and show an error message when accessed.***

**After Blocked Hours**
